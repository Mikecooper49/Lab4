    <p> Now is the winter of our discontent
        Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
        And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
        In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
        Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
        Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
        Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
        Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
